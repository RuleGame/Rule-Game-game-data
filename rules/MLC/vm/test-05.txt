#-- For the very first piece to be moved, you must use the bucket
#-- farthest away from it. After that, each piece can go to the bucket
#-- where the most recent piece of the same color was deposited, or to
#-- the bucket where the most recent piece of the same shape was
#-- deposited; but if no pieces of the same color or the same shape has
#-- been moved yet, you can use any bucket other than the one to which
#-- the most recent moved piece was deposited.
