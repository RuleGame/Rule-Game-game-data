 STUDY SUMMARY: This consent form is part of an informed consent
 process for a research study and it will provide information that
 will help you decide whether you want to take part in this study.  It
 is your choice to take part or not.
</P>

<p>
The purpose of the research is to understand how people solve categorization problems. The research is funded by the U.S. Department of Defense (DARPA). If you take part in the research, you will be asked to play a series of games involving sorting shapes. Your goal is to sort all the shapes into the correct corners of the board.  A typical study session involves several games and takes about one half-hour. 
</P>

<p>
The only burden of taking part in the study is the time and effort you
spend doing it. Benefits of participating in the study include the
compensation that has been arranged, and the possibility of having an
interesting experience and contributing to basic science.
</P>

<p>
An alternative to taking part in the research study: If you have
arranged to receive class credit for participating in the study, but
do not want to participate in it, you can arrange an alternative
method of receiving credit without participating. If you arranged any
other compensation, you may simply choose not to participate.
</P>

<p>
The information in this consent form will provide more details about the research study and what will be asked of you if you choose to take part in it. If you have any questions now or during the study, if you choose to take part, you should feel free to ask them and should expect to be given answers you completely understand.  After your questions have been answered and you wish to take part in the research study, you will be asked to sign this consent form. You are not giving up any of your legal rights by agreeing to take part in this research or by signing this consent form.

<p>
<b> Why is this study being done? </b>
The purpose of the study is to understand how people learn to solve
categorization problems. The research team is also interested in how
artificial intelligence learns to solve the same problems, and in
comparing and contrasting people’s solutions vs computers’. The
overall goal is to understand both human and machine intelligence
better.
</P>

<p>
<b> Who may take part in this study and who may not? </b>
Any adult who can read English well enough to understand the study
instructions can participate in the study.
</P>

<p>
<b> Why have I been asked to take part in this study? </b>
To better understand human behavior, we seek a wide range of ordinary
people as study participants.
</P>

<p>

<b> How long will the study take and how many subjects will take part? </b>
Each condition in this study will involve about 100 subjects, each of
whom will participate for about a half hour. There are about nine
conditions planned, for a total of about 900 subjects in total. The
project is expected to go on for several years.
</P>

<p>
<b> What will I be asked to do if I take part in this study? </b>
If you choose to participate in the study, you will be asked to play a series of shape categorization games. In each game, you will be asked to sort the game shapes into the four corners of the game board. At first you won’t know which shapes go where, but as you try shapes you will gradually figure it out. We keep track of which shapes you try to move to which corner, and will use this information to understand human learning. 
</P>

<p> <b> What are the risks of harm or discomforts I might experience if I  take part in this study? </b>
