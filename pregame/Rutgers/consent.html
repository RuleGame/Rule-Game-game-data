 <p>You are invited to participate in a research study that is being conducted by
    Jacob Feldman, Ph.D., who is a professor in the Psychology Department at Rutgers University.
     The U.S. Department of Defense is funding the study.
 </P>
 
 <p>The purpose of this research is to better understand the mechanisms 
   of human perception and cognition. Approximately 5-20 subjects between
    the ages of 18 and 25 years old will participate in each condition of this study, 
    and each individual's participation will last less than one hour.
 </P>
 
 <p>The experiment requires you, the subject, to sit in front of the computer screen,
    view a series of images, and make responses by pressing keys on the computer keyboard. 
    The task will be described in more detail before the experimental session begins.
 </P>
 
 <p>Data drawn from your session will be stored with your initials only. Since we are interested in general trends, 
   your data may be pooled with that of others.
 
   There are no risks to your health of any kind. You can stop the experiment at any time.
 </P>
 
 <p>Responses in psychology experiments are sometimes altered if the subject is aware of the hypotheses
    under consideration. Hence we cannot explain the precise purpose of the experiment until after the 
    session is over. However, afterwards the experimenter will be happy to answer any questions you might 
    have about the procedure or underlying scientific project.
 </P>
 <p>Your participation is entirely voluntary and you may stop at any time. 
   If for any reason you would like to discontinue the experiment, please end the session. 
   If you do decide to terminate the session before it is complete you will be paid or credited 
   for the time you have spent on a prorated basis.
 </P>
 
 <p>This research is confidential. Confidential means that the research records will include
    some information about you, such as your gender and age. The experimenters will keep this
     information confidential by limiting individualâ€™s access to the research data and keeping 
     it in a secure location. The research team and the Institutional Review Board at Rutgers University
     are the only parties that will be allowed to see the data, except as may be required by law. 
     If a report of this study is published, or the results are presented at a professional conference,
     all results will be anonymous. All study data will be kept for at least three years. 
     Representatives of the U.S. Department of Defense will have access to research records as part of their 
     responsibilities for human subjects protection oversight of the study.
 </P>
 
 <P>Although there are no direct benefits to you by your participation in this study,
    others in the future may benefit from the results of this research. 
    At the end of the experimental session you will receive copies of this form and the experimental
     instructions if you want them. If you have any questions about your rights as a research subject,
